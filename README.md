# Tiny-SQL

Tiny-SQL is a lightweight SQL engine built in Python. It includes a custom lexer, recursive descent parser, in-memory data storage, and execution engine to handle basic SQL operations such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `DELETE`, `UPDATE`, and `CREATE`.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Custom lexer and recursive descent parser
- Basic SQL query support:
  - `SELECT` with optional `WHERE` clause
  - `INSERT INTO`
  - `DELETE`
  - `UPDATE`
  - `CREATE`
- In-memory table management
- Modular structure with extensible components
- Optional chatbot-based SQL query interface (`chattosql.py`)
- Simple web dashboard (`dashboard.py`) for interaction

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Tiny-SQL.git
cd Tiny-SQL
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the CLI Tool

```bash
python main.py
```

### 4. Launch the Dashboard (Optional For Better Experience.)

```bash
python dashboard.py
```

## üß† How It Works

- `lexer.py`: Converts input SQL strings into tokens.
- `parser.py`: Parses the tokens into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
- `executor.py`: Evaluates the AST and interacts with `storage.py` to perform the operations.
- `storage.py`: Acts as a mock database using Python dictionaries.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Flask (for the dashboard)
- Custom-built parsing and execution engine

---

## üß© Parser Details

- **Type:** Recursive Descent Parser
- **Why:** Manually implemented parsing functions for each SQL command (e.g., `parse_select`, `parse_insert`, etc.)
- **AST Representation:** Each node is an instance of `ASTNode`.
